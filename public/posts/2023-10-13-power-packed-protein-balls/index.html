Look no further than these delightful protein balls! Packed with wholesome ingredients and a dash of humor, this recipe is sure to become your go-to snack.\nThe Protein Ball Recipe Ingredients:\n90 grams rolled oats (gluten-free if needed) 60 grams protein powder (flavor of your choice) 80 milliliters honey or maple syrup 120 grams almond butter (or any nut or seed butter of your choice) 20 grams unsweetened shredded coconut 30 grams dark chocolate chips (optional) 5 milliliters vanilla extract A pinch of salt Instructions:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats, protein powder, and unsweetened shredded coconut. Mix them well.\nAdd the almond butter, honey, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined.\nIf desired, fold in the dark chocolate chips.\nPlace the mixture in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. Chilling will make it easier to handle.\nAlternative Ingredients: Get creative with your protein balls! You can swap ingredients like almond butter for peanut butter, add dried fruits, or experiment with different types of protein powders for a unique twist.\nA Funny Anecdote One day, while making these protein balls, I realized I was out of almond butter. Determined to satisfy my snack craving, I looked for alternatives. I found a jar of sunflower seed butter in the pantry. Skeptical but adventurous, I used it in the recipe. The result? Surprisingly tasty protein balls with a subtle nutty twist! It just goes to show that experimentation in the kitchen can lead to delightful discoveries.\nStorage and Freezing Short-Term: You can store the protein balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nLong-Term: If you want to store them for a more extended period, place the protein balls in an airtight container or freezer-safe bag and store them in the freezer.\nThawing: When you’re ready to enjoy a frozen protein ball, simply remove it from the freezer and let it thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours or at room temperature for quicker thawing.\nIn Conclusion These protein balls are not only nutritious but also incredibly versatile. Experiment with flavors, share your creations with friends, and keep some in the freezer for those snack emergencies. Remember, the best recipes often start with a touch of adventure!\nSo, whether you’re fueling up for a workout or just need a quick pick-me-up during the day, these protein balls will have you covered. Enjoy the goodness and keep snacking with a smile!\nImage: Chocolate Balls with Coconut closeup image; Marco Verch Professional Photographer; CC-BY-2.0\n","wordCount":"513","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/images/protein-balls.jpg","datePublished":"2023-10-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-10-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-10-13-power-packed-protein-balls/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"https://simon.keat.es","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="https://simon.keat.es (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>https://simon.keat.es</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Power-Packed Protein Balls - Fuel Your Day with Goodness!</h1><div class=post-description>Discover how to make delicious no-bake protein balls with rolled oats and protein powder, plus a funny anecdote!
