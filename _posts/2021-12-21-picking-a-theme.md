option 1: [https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/](https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/)

option 2: [https://github.com/andrewbanchich/dimension-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/dimension-jekyll-theme)
> but no 'easy' option for blog posts

but.. could i combine 1 and 2?

also:

[https://ndrewtl.github.io/airspace-jekyll/](https://ndrewtl.github.io/airspace-jekyll/) 

and... finally settled on [Massively](https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/)

- nice background image, good looking blog posts, easy navigation
