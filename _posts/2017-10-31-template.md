<h2 id="content-is-king">Content is King</h2>
<p>Content satisfies the people viewing your website and it also makes search engines happy! Having strong content makes your marketing job a heck of a lot easier. Then, instead of pushing something irrelevant to your users, you can give them something that will stick. You’ll give them something they can relate to and be inclined to share with their friends and coworkers. Maybe they’ll even be inclined to work with you in the future!</p>
